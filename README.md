# Hospital-Patient-Data-Managing-System

Hospital and patient data managing systems are a very important application for hospitals and patients. This kind of  application already exists but the patient details and reports are monitored within their hospital  itself. If a patient goes to another hospital, other hospitals can’t get patients' previous medical reports. So to overcome this, we created separate applications to get patients' details. 

This overall system  helps hospitals to monitor patients' details  from other  hospitals and, similarly, patients can track their reports and details. Basically, we build this application as both an app and a web application by using  HTML , CSS and JAVASCRIPT for web development and JAVA for app development. 

The main objective of our project is to integrate the hospitals. Because each hospital  uses their own database.This database is related only to one hospital.  
The hospital's  database was not integrated with other hospital databases, because every hospital has its own database. 

There is not any common database to integrate every hospital. By integrating every hospital , hospitals can see their patient medical and treatment details where patients have taken treatment in other hospitals. Patients also can see their details like medical reports, medicine details and hospital details about where they went for treatment. 

So to get the patient medicine details, reports and where patient have taken treatment. This data is stored on Google and displayed on mobile apps.
